# pathfinding
Amazon pathfinding coding challenge

pathfinding_phase_one.py:
  Completes phase one of the challenge where there is a 10x10 grid, and a path must be found from the start square (0,0) to the end square (9,9) around 4 fixed obstacles.
  The resultant path is printed to the command line
  
pathfinding_phase_two.py:
  Completes phase two of the challenge. Similar to phase one except an additional 20 obstacles are randomly placed on the grid. If no path from start to destination exists, an appropriate message is printed
  
bonus.py:
  Completes the bonus task. Similar to phase two, except in the case where there is no path from start to destination, a path traversing the least obstacles is found. The locations of these obstacles are also printed.
